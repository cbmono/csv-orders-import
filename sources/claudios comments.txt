- Products without SKU and Name shouldn't be allowed
- Customer: at least one field should be mandatory
- Customer.email should be unique
- CustomerAddress contains first_name and last_name to avoid problems in case buying something for someone else
- Added a postfix to every last_name (Smith [A-I]) to avoid confusion, since we only have "John Smith's"
- Orders without any kind of price shouldn't be allowed
- Order should contain a copy of invoice and shipping address
