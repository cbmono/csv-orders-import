- Assumption: partnerA.PORPOS --> total amount (price)
- Assumption: partnerA.PRAEMIENNUMMER --> product sku
- partnerB: calculate total amount as: (qty * item_price) + shipping_total

- Products without SKU and Name shouldn't be allowed
- Customer.email should be unique
- Order should contain a copy of invoice and shipping address
- CustomerAddress contains first_name and last_name to avoid problems in case buying something for someone else
- Added a postfix to every last_name (Smith [A-I]) to avoid confusion
- Maybe it would make sense to save all customer address details into tbl:orders
